      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      # This line means Kafka will only save 1 copy of consumer progress data (called offsets).
      KAFKA_CONFLUENT_LICENSE_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      # That's because Kafka will try to create the internal topic with 2 or 3 copies (replicas) — but since there's only 1 broker,
      # it can't do that.Just create 1 copy of the topic. This avoids the crash in a single-broker setup.
      KAFKA_CONFLUENT_BALANCER_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      # this line tells kafka to create only 1 copy of the topic used by the Auto Data Balancer.It is needed because you are using only 1 Kafka broker.
      # Without it, Kafka may try to create 3 copies and crash.
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 1
      # ISR = In-Sync Replicas I have only 1 broker. So it’s okay if just that broker is in-sync.
      # Don’t wait for more brokers to write transaction data.
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      # Normally, Kafka tries to create 3 copies of this topic for safety.
      # But you're using only 1 broker → Kafka cannot create 3 copies. Just create 1 copy, that’s enough for now.
      # Kafka, create only 1 copy of the topic that stores transaction data
